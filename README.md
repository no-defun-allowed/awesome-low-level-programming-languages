# awesome-low-level-programming-languages

A curated list of **low level** programming languages primarily aimed at OS and game
programming.

**They are all shit.** [Operating systems should not exist](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html), and [gameshit focus on performance is a hazard to society.](https://plover.com/~mjd/misc/hbaker-archive/letters/CACM-DubiousAchievement.html) Thanks for coming to my TED talk

This list is perfect, so don't bother sending pull-requests.
